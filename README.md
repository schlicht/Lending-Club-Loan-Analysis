# Lending-Club-Loan-Analysis
This project analyzes [loans](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data) from [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com) and builds a model to predict the likelihood of repayment. Just open up the Python Notebook for the analysis.

## Synopsis
LendingClub is a platform for crowdsourcing loans. Applicants request loans which are reviewed by LendingClub in order to filter out risky loans. Loans are then rank on likelihood of defaulting based on the applicants FICO score and information and an interest rate is selected based on risk. Lenders are able to build a portfolio composed of partial funding of hundreds of loans or individually selected loans to fund.

## Conclusion
Ultimately, we were successful in building a model to predict the likelihood of default and determining the most relavent indicators (revolving debt utilization, debt to income ratio, and annual income). Further analysis could develop a model for developing a portfolio that maximizes returns based on interest rate and probability of default.
